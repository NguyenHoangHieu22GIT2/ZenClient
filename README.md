# Zen - Social Media For Everyone.

### Modern - Fast - Easy

#### 1. First Information

This is my project of trying to recreate something like Facebook, a Social Media. I want to create a social media website that can do pretty much everything like facebook, from that I can use this project to append more features in the future such as games, 3D model, and more AI features.

a project with a topic of social media is too broad, which is a very bad thing for **_beginners_** but for me, it's such a great idea since I can improve it along the way. With more knowledge I learnt, I can implement it to my project without knowing it will be off-topic since it's pretty broad. Giving me more time to implement new features instead of creating a new project.

Of course this won't be my last project, I am intending to create something like Notion as well, I think I will name it NoteIt (pretty lame I know), I have learnt a lot with this project, something like get more understanding at looking at the way front-end and back-end works, and I more understanding of using react ( Next.JS ) and Nest.JS knowledge.

Still I want to create more different topic. I am passionate of new things that I want to accomplish. But this project still has a long way to go and I want to finish it,at least it has to look like facebook.
